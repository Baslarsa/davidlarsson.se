### David Larsson - Web Page

This is my personal website frontend built in React.
All styling is made with emotion/react {css, useTheme, ThemeProvider}. 

The ThemeProvider was something new for me while doing this site, that's why it may seem a bit messy here and there. 

I'm using Strapi as CMS and have deployed it on Heroku.
